* Prerequisite
Student should be comfortable with linear algebra, probability, statistics,
optimization and  programming experience in python and its scientifc libraries. We will cover some basics in the class.
-  [[http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf][linear algebra overview]] 
-  Read chapter 2 of Kevin Murphy for probabilty and statistics review or any other text you have used in the past
* TextBooks
- *Required:*
  -  [[https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/][Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin Patrick Murphy]]. Online version is available in the [[https://library.du.edu/][DU library]].
- *Optional:*  [[http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/][An Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani]]. It is available online in pdf format
- *Optional:*  [[http://www.deeplearningbook.org/][Deep learning]]  by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville.   It is available online.
- *Optional:* For more advance treatment [[https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/][The Elements of Statistical Learning]]. It is available online in pdf format   
* Course Description
We will go though theory behind
machine learning using tool from probability and linear algebra.
We will use python, its [[https://www.scipy.org/][scientific libraries]] (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, Pandas etc.)
and [[http://scikit-learn.org/stable/][scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python]] during the course. For deep neural network part, we will use
highly popular [[https://www.tensorflow.org/][tensorflow Machine Intelligence]] library from the Google. For assignments, starter code  or hint will be given. 
At the end of the course one should be able to understand theory behind various
machine learning algorithms with a unifying perspective from probability theory, be comfortable using open source tools for building machine learning systems.

* Software
Please install [[https://www.anaconda.com/download/][Anaconda for Python 3.6 version data science platform. ]]Please install it before coming in the class on Tuesday.
See the youtube link [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOFONKvaz0A][Installing Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook]]. 
You can also go to my  [[https://github.com/psnegi/PythonForReproducibleResearch][python for reproducible research]]  github repository and start by running pythonBasic.ipynb notebook.
I will go over basic of python and jupyter notebook. For Deep Neural networks, we will go over tensorlfow and keras installation instruction later in the course.
** Tensorflow and Keras

* Grading
There will be one mid term, a final exam, homework assignments, in class quizzes.
Worst 2 of your homework assignments and 2 quizzes will be dropped. Students enrolled in 
 COMP 4432 1,  will be asked to do slightly more homework questions.
